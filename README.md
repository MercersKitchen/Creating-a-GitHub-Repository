Open Chrome, Navigate to GitHub

Creating a GitHub Repository
- Login to GitHub
- Click Repositories
- BIG GREEN BUTTON: Create a Repository using the big Green Buttons
  - Title: anything you want
  - Description: must include due to past bug
- Navigate to the contents of the repository
- Open Repository using GitHub Desktop (Option in Big Green Button)
  - Reminder: click the box, Always Open, in the JavaScript Dialogue Box

Open ReadMe.md for Developer Details and other ReadMe File details
  - Ideas and reminders here only
  - Simple Markdown and HTML will format ideas for consumption
  - Create an index.html file for Promotional Details
  - General Ideas
    - Notice most images and videos are also linked in ReadMe.md
    - This delivery of content is for GitHub-hosted website
    - Promotion, formatting, website building, etc. will be more developed in this
    doc
  - Expectations for index.html (must be named index.html for GitHub Hosting)
    - In the project folder, create a Text Doc and rename it index.html
    - Right-click index.html, open with Atom
    - Type html in the document to create a  boilerplate
    - Create additional links for CSS and JavaScript
  - If working in Processing-Java: immediately create a Processing DOC and save it
  - Will Create Processing Folder for DOC (needed by Java Compiler), exactly the
    same name as Processing-Java File name
  - If working in Atom (or other WYSIWYG):
  - immediately create file names with proper extensions

Reopen GitHub Desktop
  - Title Changes in Version Control (log notes you can access and review later)
  - Update Master (version saved to your hard drive, able to review these changes
  		 in the log notes)
  - Push to the Cloud

  CONGRADULATIONS: you have now created a GitHub Repository and Project Folder
  for collaboration
